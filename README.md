### List of assignments:
1. **SortTools** - write a class with some specified methods that help with sorting operations on arrays.
2. **MasterMind** - create an implementation of a MasterMind game (computer version of this game: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game)
3. **Word Ladder** - given two five letter words (words A & B), find a ladder from word A to word B by sellecting words from a huge list of 5 letter words. Each next word in a ladder can differ only by a single letter with the previous one. 
4. **Critter World** - create a server and a client programms for a game of Critters (you create bot, which spwans some players every turn, they move on a grid and have to fight with other bots while eating food to survive - something similar to MIT's http://www.battlecode.org/)
5. **Critter World GUI + extra functionality** - create a GUI for the game from project 4. Add some extra functionality/complexity to the game. 
6. **Booking client & server** - project on multithreading. Create a theater box office class and a client class. Multiple clients have to be able to comunicate with the box office, however no double bookings are allowed - box office has to be robust and control sumulataneously. 
7. **Chat room** - project on networking. Create a chat program, such that when lounched on different computers with access to the internet, communication between them is possible.
